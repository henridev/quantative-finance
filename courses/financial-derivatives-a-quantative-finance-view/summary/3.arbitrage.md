# Arbitrage

The rough idea:

- a riskless profit.
- investment oportunity in which have a chance of making a profit and no chance of losing money.

Mathematical definition:

- portfolio with value $V(t)$
- satisfying $V(0) \leq 0$
  - you can enter in to the portfolio without spending money
  - this means there is no possiblity to lose money from $T$ onwards
- and for some time $T > 0$ in the future
- $\color{red}{Prob(V(T)< 0) = 0\text{ and } Prob(V(T) > 0) > 0}$
  - from $T$ there will definitly be profit

> a portfolio can be entered into at no cost and it will yield a certain and positive profit at some time $t>0$

How to apply arbitrage:

- principle: arbitrage cannot exist
- if we make assumptions and those assumptions imply that an arbitrage portfolio exists we can rule out those assumptions (contradiction)

arbitrage for pricing:

1. assume two assets do not have the same price
2. show that that assumption allows for the construction of an arbitrage portfolio
3. conclude that 2 assets have the same price because we said arbitrage does not exist

## example of arbitrage

### example 1

if we add row one of the table to two times the second row we will end up with the third row.

$P_{a}(1) + 2P_{b}(1) = P_{c}(1)$

if we use this relationship at $t=0$

$P_{a}(0) + 2P_{b}(0) =25 + (20 * 2)$

$P_{a}(0) + 2P_{b}(0) =65$

$65 < 80$

this shows that stock c is overpriced at $t=0$

procedure to construct an arbitrage when you suspect 2 assets ate mispriced relative to eachother.

> long the underpriced asset and short the overpriced asset.

here this becomes:

- long assets a and b
- short asset c

at time $t=0$ we will enter in the following portfolio

cost of entering in long position.

$P_a(0)+2P_b(0) = 25 + 2 * 20 = 65\$$

cash received from short position.

$P_c(0) = 80$$

the cash received will cover the long positions. Next to that there is still 15$ left than can be invested in the risk free rate

$V(0) = + 15e^{r_{d}t}$

holding the positions until t=1 we know certainly that the following relation will hold.

$P_{a}(1) + 2P_{b}(1) = P_{c}(1)$

we will need to sell because one share of c needs to be returned to the owner. We do this by selling shares a and b

$P_{a}(1) + 2P_{b}(1) = P_{c}(1)$

this will make us able to close out the short and long position.

> in the end we still have the $\color{green}{\$15}$ profit realized at $t=0$

this portfolio was riskless and we did not spend anything to enter in it.

Therefore this is an arbitrage portfolio.

### example 2

![example](../images/Screenshot%202023-05-01%20090450.png)

$FairValue = \frac{600}{(1+0.0-75)} + \frac{600}{(1+0.015)^{2}} + \frac{10600}{(1+0.02)^{3}} = \$11166.55$

so this bond is underpriced. Arbitrage will involve taking a long position in the bond.

$\frac{600}{(1+0.0-75)} = 595.53$

$\frac{600}{(1+0.015)^{2}} = 583.40$

$\frac{10600}{(1+0.02)^{3}} = 9988.62$

we can borrow these amounts of money and set their corresponding debt payments equal to the coupon payments. this way the bond payments will finance the debt.

> this can be seen as equivalent to selling 3 zero coupon bonds with the bond paymenrs as the par values.

This means we will borrow 595.53 over 1y, 583.40 over 2 y, 9988.62 over 3y.

thsi will mean in our portfolio $595.53 + 583.40 + 9988.62 = \$11166.55$ cash. $\$ 10000$ of it will be used to buy our bond. This holding will be invested at risk free rate.

<span style="color:red;">
This portfolio does not require any entry costs
</span>

</br>

$V(t)= 11166.55 + 595.53 - 583.40 - 9988.62 +(1166.55 * (1.02)^{3})$

$V(t)= (1166.55 * (1.02)^{3})$

value of cash = $(1166.55 * (1.02)^{3}) = \$1237.95$

This portfolio has a positive and certain profit

## Law of one price

---
Definition:

Say we have assets A and B where Prices $P_{a}(t)$ and $P_{b}(t)$ are prices at time $t$. Then there is $Prob(P_{a}(t) = P_{b}(t)) = 1$ for some time $t>0$.

Then one of two things has to be true.

- $P_{a}(0) = P_{b}(0)$
- There is an arbitrage.
---
Justification of the law of one price:

Suppose $P_{a}(0) \neq P_{b}(0)$:

- these are the prices known today so not random.
- This means one had to be bigger than the other $P_{a}(0) > P_{b}(0)$ or $P_{a}(0) < P_{b}(0)$. Let's assume $P_{a}(0) > P_{b}(0)$.

now let's construct an arbitrage.

- short position in A
- long position in B

long position would be buying asset B. A short position could be borrowing asset A selling it and promissing to return it on a future date.

This means following cashflows:

- add $P_{a}(0)$
- remove $P_{b}(0)$
- this leaves us cash $P_{a}(0) - P_{b}(0)$

now we have a portfolio containing

- hold asset B
- short position on asset A = obligation to return a to it's owner
- cash, assumed to be held at the risk free rate

<span style="color:red;">
This portfolio does not require any entry costs
</span>

we will hold on to the portfolio until $t$.

at $t = t$ the portfolio consists of:

- hold asset B
- short position on asset A = obligation to return a to it's owner
- cash, assumed to be held at the risk free rate $(P_{a}(0) - P_{b}(0))e^{r_{c}t}$

</br>

$V(t)= P_{b}(t) - P_{a}(t) - (P_{a}(0) - P_{b}(0))e^{r_{c}t}$

we will sell asset B to finance to buy of asset A. This will clear both our long and short position.

value of cash = $V(t) = (P_{a}(0) - P_{b}(0))e^{r_{c}t}$

</br>

<span style="color:red;">
This portfolio has a positive and certain profit
</span>

</br>

### Extensions and examples

if two securities with certainty, pay the exact same cash flows then they should have the same price at any time during their lives.

if A and B are 2 assets with prices $P_{a}(t)$ and $P_{b}(t)$ and if at some time $T > 0$ we can say.

- $P_{a}(T) \geq P_{a}(T)$ with prob = 1
- then we must have $P_{a}(t) \geq P_{a}(t)$ for any $t < T$

Applying the law of one price: **replication arguments**

Suppose we want to price asset A at time $t$. we can denote this a $P_{A}(t)$.

Suppose there is a portfolio we can construct with value $V(t)$ at some time $t$ we need to know the price of $P_{a}(t)$.

Suppose for some time $T>t$ we know $Prob(V(t) = P_{a}(t)) = 1$
We will construct or portfolio so that this will happen.

From this the law of one price can be applied $V(t) = P_{a}(t)$ for any time $t < T$. If this is not the case there is an oppotunity for arbitrage.

---

example of three stocks:

Suppose we have a portfolio containing 1 share of A and 2 shares of B. We will call this portfolio asset 1 and denote it's value at time $t$ as $V_{1}(t)$

$V_{1}(t) = P_{a}(t) + 2P_{b}(t)$

We also have asset 2 which will consist of one share of C

$V_{2}(t) = P_{c}(t)$

the finding from the previous analysis of this example was that at $t = 1$

$Prob(V_{1}(t) = V_{2}(t)) = 1$

this means according to the law of one price that either

- $V_{1}(0) = V_{2}(0)$
- there is an arbitrage

from our given data we found

 $V_{1}(0) = 65 < V_{2}(0) = 80$

given this fact we can explicitly construct an arbitrage portfolio.

---

example of bond: 

using the law of one price to solve this problem.

Our initial conclusion was the bond that was priced at par value was mispriced. 

We could have reached that conclusion as an application of the cash flow version of the law of one price.

our bond was nothing more than the equivalent of the right to receive three cashflows:

$600 + 600 + 10600$

how can we construct a portfolio to replicate this?

This portfolio is implicit in the way we treated the problem before.

- take out three loans corresponding to each cash flow payment, this is equivalent to shorting 3 zero coupon bonds.
- this indicates a replicating portfolio consist of 3 zero coupon bonds
  - $Z_{1}$ = zero coupon bond with 1Y maturity and 600$ face value
  - $Z_{2}$ = zero coupon bond with 2Y maturity and 600$ face value
  - $Z_{3}$ = zero coupon bond with 3Y maturity and 10600$ face value
- a portfolio with these three zero coupon bonds has the same cash flow as our long bond and so by **cash flow version the law of one price** the price of the bond must agree with the values of this portfolio at any time during its life
- keep in mind the risk free rates for the terms
  - $r(1) = 0.0075$ 
  - $r(2) = 0.015$ 
  - $r(3) = 0.02$
- this will give us prices of zero coupon bonds today
  - $\frac{Z_{1}}{1 + r(1)} = \$595.53$ 
  - $\frac{Z_{2}}{(1 + r(2))^{2}} = \$582.40$ 
  - $\frac{Z_{3}}{(1 + r(3))^{3}} = \$9988.62$ 

the expected price of our long bond would thus be $B(0) = \$595.53+\$582.40+\$9988.62 = \$11166.85$

## Arbitrage and discounted cash flow analysis

we can look at the **time value of money** and **discounted cash flow analysis** from the point of view of **arbitrage** and **the law of one price**.

**Arbitrage** is in fact what justifies the notion of time value of money and the idea of present value.

**Present value** = the value today of the amount of $X$ received at time $t$. The value that should be invested today at prevailing interest rates to get to the amount $X$ at time $t$.

$PV(t) = e^{-(r_{c}t)}X$

> now from the viewpoint of the law of one price 

if we invest $PV$ today, this asset will be equal in value to the payment at time $t$

 law of one price states that either:

- $PV$ is the price today of any asset paying $X$ at time $t$
- or there is arbitrage opportunity

so $PV$ of the payment is exactly the value determined by arbitrage considerations

### example

<img src="..\images\Screenshot 2023-05-01 114014.png" alt="example-arbitrage" style="zoom: 33%; margin:auto;" /> 

 $PV = 10000 * e^{-(r_{c}t)} = 10000 * e^{-(0.06 * 3)} = \$8352.7$ 

if the contract is trading at 9000 there is a shorting arbitrage opportunity, because the contract is overpriced

we would like to sell this contract at this rate which will give us a 9000 cash payment which can be invested at the risk free rate.

$9000 * e^{(r_{c}t)} = 9000 * e^{(0.06 * 3)} = 10775$

this will leave us with 

$10775 - 10000 = \$775$ cash when the position is cleared

if the contract is trading at 7000 there is a longing arbitrage opportunity, because the contract is underpriced

we would like to buy this contract at this rate which will mean we need to borrow 7000 at the risk free rate 

$7000 * e^{(r_{c}t)} = 7000 * e^{(0.06 * 3)} = 8380.52$

this will leave us with 

$10000 - 8380.52= \$1619.48$ cash when the position is cleared

### generalizing 

using discounted cash flow analysis as a valuation procedure is generally an example of arbitrage pricing.

the form of arbitrage principle closest to the circumstances of discounted cash flow analysis is the cash flow version of the law of one price.

> Present value of stream of cash flows = the amount of money we would need to invest at current prevailing risk free rates to exactly replicate cash flow streams until time $t$



example 

> discounted cash flow analysis: 
>
> security is making payments: $c_{1}+c_{2}+...+c_{3}$
>
> at times: $t_{1}+t_{2}+...+t_{3}$
>
> each of these payments can be replicated by zero coupon bonds maturing at the time of payment with face value equal to the payment
>
> a portfolio of all $n$ of the zero coupon bonds exactly replicates the cash flow
>
> value of portfolio at time $t$:
>
> $V(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}Z_{i}(t)$
>
> for the $i$ th zero coupon bond we will have 
>
> $Z_{i}(t_{i}) = c_{i}$
>
> so value at time zero of the bond is the discounted value of the payment today
>
> $Z_{i}(0) = d(t_{i})c_{i}$
>
> let $P(0)$ be the value of the cash flow (in particular $PV = P(0)$).
>
> according to the law of one price
>
> $P(0) = V(0)$
>
> $P(0) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}Z_{i}(0)$
>
> $P(0) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}d(t_{i})c_{i}$
>
> this reproduces the formula for discounted cash flow analysis

this shows us that **Discounted cash flow analysis** and **bond pricing** are special cases of **arbitrage pricing**
