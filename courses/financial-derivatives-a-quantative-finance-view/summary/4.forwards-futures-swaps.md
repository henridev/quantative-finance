## derivatives

> financial products / assets whose structure and value is derived from other assets. This base asset is called the **underlying asset** but is usually referred to as the **underlying**.

> an **underlying** and a derivate are usually through the payoffs. the payoff of a derivative will usually be determined by the price of the underlying asset, at some point in the derivative contract's life, often on its expiration date.
>
> **arbitrage** is the main tool to link the derivative value to the underlying price

- **cash price / spot price** = price of the underlying asset. Distinguish it from the price of the derivative.
- **cash market** = where the underlying assets are traded, when the underlying is a cash product which it usually  is.
- **P&L** = changes in value of an investment or financial position. This position can be a single asset or a portfolio

assumptions when treating derivatives:

- transaction costs are zero
- unlimited investing and borrowing at risk free rate
- no restrictions on short selling an asset

types of derivatives

- **forwards / futures** = contracts that lock in the price 2 parties will buy and sell an asset for at some future date 
- **option** = similar to forward but optional
- **swaps** = allow for swapping a floating with a fixed interest rate

### derivative markets

- OTC = bilateral deals between counterparties that deal directly with each other
  - between broker-dealers and clients
  - or between broker-dealers themselves
  - private and customizable
  - little price transparency
  - lightly regulated
  - higher counter party credit risk
- organized exchanges 
  - products are standardized 
  - more liquid than OTC
  - less change of counterparty credit risk
  - more transparent

> **counter party credit risk** =  risk that one of the parties on the contract might fail to meet their obligations

## forward contracts

agreement between seller and buyer in which they agree to sell/buy at a certain time in the future for a price agreed upon now.

- **long** = buyer, because for him the underlying price increase is good
- **short** = seller, because for him the underlying price decrease is good 
- **expiration data** = agreed transfer date
- **forward price** = contracted price

the traded asset is the underlying of the forward.

> when a forward is entered into, the forward price is not arbitrary instead it is calculated in such a way that the value of the forward contract upon entering it will be = 0
>
> the requirement that the forward contract has value 0 at origination ties the forward price to the current spot price, that is to the current market price of the asset



- forwards can be written on almost any asset at all.
- forward contracts are privately negotiated between counterparties, on OTC markets and can be highly customized to suit the two counterparties.
- usually one party is a financial institution / dealer while the other can be a non financial institution or another dealer. 
- the primary reasons for users to use forwards is risk management.

### settlement

- delivery = seller exchanges the underlying asset for the contracted price with the buyer
- cash settlement = the party in the negative position will pay this in cash the the party in the positive position

- usually these contracts are held to expiry and illiquid because they are custom
- counterparty credit risk is a serious concern
- the last two points are in contrast to **exchange traded future contracts**

## forward payoffs

revenues a particular counterparty earns from their position in the derivative contract as the derivatives payoff.

payments are only received after expiration.

at expiration the payoff equals the value of the forward contract for either position / party. The long / short payoff respectively.

all value of a forward contract derives from it's payoff at expiration.

### forward contract notation

$S(t)$ = price of underlying asset at time $t$

$K_{\tau}$ = forward price for expiry $\tau$

$T$ = expiration date

$r$ = risk free rate

$V(t)$ = value of long forward position at time $t$

we start by considering:

â€‹	$V(T)$ = long forward payoff

 which cashflows does the long receive and pay at expiration of the forward contract. 

- $+S(T)$ = price of underlying at expiration, cash flow in essence but in reality the actual asset (can be sold)
- $-K_{T}$ = forward price set in the contract
- in total this means $\color{red}{V(t) = S(T) - K(T)} =$ payoff for long
- the payoff for the short is just the opposite $\color{red}{-V(T)=K(T)-S(T)}$
