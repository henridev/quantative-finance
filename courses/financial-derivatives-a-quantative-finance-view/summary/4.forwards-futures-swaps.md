## 1. derivatives

> financial products / assets whose structure and value is derived from other assets. This base asset is called the **underlying asset** but is usually referred to as the **underlying**.

> an **underlying** and a derivate are usually through the payoffs. the payoff of a derivative will usually be determined by the price of the underlying asset, at some point in the derivative contract's life, often on its expiration date.

> **arbitrage** is the main tool to link the derivative value to the underlying price

- **cash price / spot price** = price of the underlying asset. Distinguish it from the price of the derivative.
- **cash market** = where the underlying assets are traded, when the underlying is a cash product which it usually  is.
- **P&L** = changes in value of an investment or financial position. This position can be a single asset or a portfolio

assumptions when treating derivatives:

- transaction costs are zero
- unlimited investing and borrowing at risk free rate
- no restrictions on short selling an asset

types of derivatives

- **forwards / futures** = contracts that lock in the price 2 parties will buy and sell an asset for at some future date 
- **option** = similar to forward but optional
- **swaps** = allow for swapping a floating with a fixed interest rate

### 1.1 derivative markets

- OTC = bilateral deals between counterparties that deal directly with each other
  - between broker-dealers and clients
  - or between broker-dealers themselves
  - private and customizable
  - little price transparency
  - lightly regulated
  - higher counter party credit risk
- organized exchanges
  - products are standardized
  - more liquid than OTC
  - less change of counterparty credit risk
  - more transparent

> **counter party credit risk** =  risk that one of the parties on the contract might fail to meet their obligations

## 2. forward contracts

agreement between seller and buyer in which they agree to sell/buy at a certain time in the future for a price agreed upon now.

- **long** = buyer, because for him the underlying price increase is good
- **short** = seller, because for him the underlying price decrease is good.
- **expiration data** = agreed transfer date
- **forward price** = contracted price

the traded asset is the underlying of the forward.

> when a forward is entered into, the forward price is not arbitrary instead it is calculated in such a way that the value of the forward contract upon entering it will be = 0
>
> the requirement that the forward contract has value 0 at origination ties the forward price to the current spot price, that is to the current market price of the asset



- forwards can be written on almost any asset at all.
- forward contracts are privately negotiated between counterparties, on OTC markets and can be highly customized to suit the two counterparties.
- usually one party is a financial institution / dealer while the other can be a non financial institution or another dealer. 
- the primary reasons for users to use forwards is risk management.

### 2.1 settlement

- delivery = seller exchanges the underlying asset for the contracted price with the buyer
- cash settlement = the party in the negative position will pay this in cash the the party in the positive position

- usually these contracts are held to expiry and illiquid because they are custom
- counterparty credit risk is a serious concern
- the last two points are in contrast to **exchange traded future contracts**

## 3. forward payoffs

revenues a particular counterparty earns from their position in the derivative contract as the derivatives payoff.

payments are only received after expiration.

at expiration the payoff equals the value of the forward contract for either position / party. The long / short payoff respectively.

all value of a forward contract derives from it's payoff at expiration.

### 3.1 forward contract notation

| Notation   | Meaning                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| $S(t)$     | price of underlying asset at time $t$      |
| $K_{\tau}$ | forward price for expiry $\tau$            |
| $T$        | expiration date                            |
| $r$        | risk free rate                             |
| $V(t)$     | value of long forward position at time $t$ |

consider:

â€‹	$\color{purple}V(T)$ = long forward payoff

then the cashflows at expiration for the long position on this forward contract will be. 

| Positive                                                     | Negative                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\color{green}+S(T)$ = price of underlying at expiration, cash flow in essence but in reality the actual asset (can be sold) | $\color{red}-K_{T}$ = forward price set in the contract |

in total this means the payoff for the long position will be $\color{orange}{V(t) = S(T) - K(T)}$ 

the short will have the opposite payoff $\color{orange}{-V(T)=K(T)-S(T)}$

## 4. pricing forward contracts

### 4.1 value the **long** position using the law of one price.

construct a portfolio reflecting the payoff of a long position on a forward contract at time $t=T$.

$V(T) = S(T)-K_{T}$

- $\color{purple}S(T)$ is like holding the underlying. Holding it in the portfolio will replicate this
- $\color{purple}- K_{T}$ is like a payment (a debt). The discounted absolute value of this would be $\color{purple}e^{-r_cT}K_{T}$

in short: we can replicate the portfolio by

- a long position in the underlying asset
- a debt of $\color{purple}e^{-r_cT}K_{T}$ entered at time $\color{purple}t=0$



such a portfolio will have value:

$V(t) = S(t) - e^{r_{c}t}e^{-r_{c}T}K_{T} = \color{orange}S(t) - e^{-r_{c}(T-t)}K_{T}$



we check if this is a replicating portfolio by evaluating $V(T)$
$$
V(T) = S(T) - e^{-r_{c}(T-T)}K_{T} \\ \\

V(T) = S(T) - e^{0}K_{T} \\ \\

V(T) = S(T) - K_{T}
$$
this is the forward payoff thus this must be a replicating portfolio.

---

the law of one price states: 

The value of **<u>the forward contract</u>** 

at any time $\color{purple}t<T$ 

must be $\color{purple}V(t)$ the value of the replicating portfolio. 

| Long                                               | Short                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| $\color{orange}{V(t) = S(T) - e^{r_{c}(T-t)}K(T)}$ | $\color{orange}{-V(t) = e^{r_{c}(T-t)}K(T) - S(T)}$ |

more specifically value today should be $\color{purple}V(0) = 0$. 

The forward price $\color{purple}K_{T}$ is set so that the value of the forward contract today is 0.
$$
V(0) = 0 \\
 
 V(0) = S(0) - e^{-r_{c}(T-0)}K_{T}\\
 
 S(0) =  e^{-r_{c}(T)}K_{T}
$$

the forward price:
$$
\color{orange}K_{T} = S(0)e^{r_{c}(T)}
$$

## 5. Cash and carry arbitrage

**forward price** can be deduced from 2 arbitrage strategies.

- cash and carry arbitrage
- reverse cash and carry arbitrage

This is a more direct argument then applying the law of one price and replication in the previous chapter.

The formula we derived was:
$$
K_{T} = e^{r_c{T}}S(0)
$$

> now we will derive the forward price from a direct arbitrage argument.

we need to show that:

$$
K_{T} < e^{r_c{T}}S(0) \lor K_{T} > e^{r_c{T}}S(0)
$$
leads to arbitrage. Thus we need to prove the forward price is as given above.

### 5.1 constructing an arbitrage portfolio

#### ***5.1.1 overpriced forward contract price***

Suppose: 
$$
K_{T} > e^{r_c{T}}S(0)
$$

- short position 
- expecting the underlying asset price to be lower than contract price.

Strategy:

- borrow $\color{purple}S(0)$ at risk free rate $\color{purple}r$ 
- use borrowed money to purchase the underlying asset.

Our portfolio consists of:

- the short forward position
- the underlying asset
- a debt of $\color{purple}S(0)e^{rt}$ at time $\color{purple}t$

Close position:

- hold portfolio till time $\color{purple}T$
- At $\color{purple}T$ provide the underlying to the long holder for the contract price $\color{purple}K_{T}$.
- with these proceeds we can close our debt of $\color{purple}S(0)e^{rT}$.

net profit:
$$
\color{purple}K_{T}-S(0)e^{rT}>0
$$

> this is arbitrage as it costs us nothing to enter into the portfolio but it will net us a certain profit. This strategy is **cash and carry arbitrage**

---

#### ***5.1.2 suppose forward contract price is underpriced***

Suppose: 
$$
K_{T} < e^{r_c{T}}S(0)
$$

- long position because
- the contract price is bellow what we expect.

Strategy:

- short the underlying, borrowing it then selling it which will give us $\color{purple}S(0)e^{r_{c}}$ cash.

Our portfolio consists of:

- the long forward position
- the short position in the underlying asset
- a cash holding of $\color{purple}S(0)e^{rt}$ at time $\color{purple}t$

Close position:

- hold portfolio till time $\color{purple}T$
- At $\color{purple}T$ we will have a cash holding $\color{purple}e^{r_c{T}}S(0) > K_{T}$.
- With this cash we can pay $\color{purple}K_{T}$ which will give us the underlying which we can then use to close out our underlying short position.

Net profit:
$$
S(0)e^{rT}-K_{T}>0
$$

> this is arbitrage as it costs us nothing to enter into the portfolio but it will net us a certain profit. This strategy is **reverse cash and carry arbitrage**

---

#### ***5.1.3 summary***

given 

$$
K_{T} < S(0)e^{rT}
$$
or 

$$
K_{T} > S(0)e^{rT}
$$
there will arbitrage.

by assumptions arbitrage does not exist thus.

$$
K_{T} = S(0)e^{rT}
$$

---

**5.1.3.1 Cash and carry arbitrage**
$$
K_{T} > e^{r_c{T}}S(0)
$$

1. borrow cost of asset
2. purchase underlying with borrowed cash
3. hold asset till forward expires.

The notion of **cost of carry** is the cost to hold the asset.

in this case the only cost to hold is the finance charge so.

$\text{cost of carry} = r$

> cost of carry generally includes costs such as financing charges, storage costs, transportation costs and other holding costs. net of any income the holder of the asset receives such as dividends or convenience yields
>
> we will see more general examples of cost of carry appearing in the pricing formula for more general assets such as income bearing assets and commodities.

**5.1.3.1 Reverse Cash and carry arbitrage**
$$
K_{T} < e^{r_c{T}}S(0)
$$
Is the exact reverse of the cash and carry argument. We short the underlying. Receive the carry charge as income instead of paying it.

## 6. forward example: zero coupon bond

example:

zero coupon bond:

- $m = 1Y$
- $r_{c} = 3.5\%$
- $S_{b}(0) = \$925$ 

what will be forward price for a 6m forward contract on this bond.
$$
K_{T} = S_{b}(0)e^{r(T-t)} \\

K_{T} = \$925*e^{0.035(1-0.5)} \\ = \$941.33
$$

### 6.1 cash and carry

if the forward price offered is $\$950$

this means that 
$$
K_{T} > S_{b}(t)e^{r(T-t)}
$$
this means we should short the forward contract which means using the **cash and carry strategy**.

Strategy:

- borrow for cash equal to $\color{purple}S(0)$ this will be debt $\color{purple}S(0)e^{rT}$
- with the borrowed cash we buy the underlying bond

Cash Flows:

- borrowing will set us back $\color{purple}\$925 * e^{0.035t}$
- in six months this will be $\color{purple}\$925 * e^{0.035*0.5}=\$941.33$

Close:

- sell at $\color{purple}K_{T}$ 
- we can use the acquired cash to close our debt.

net profit:

$\color{purple}\$950 - \$941.33 = \$8.67$

### 6.2 reverse cash and carry

imagine the second dealer offers a forward price of $\color{purple}\$935$
$$
\$935 < \$941.33 \\

K_{T} < S_{b}(0)e^{r_{c}*(T-t)}
$$
we want to take a long position on this forward contract



Strategy:

- short the underlying asset
- a cash investment of $\color{purple}\$925e^{0.035t}$ at time $\color{purple}t$

Cash flows:

$\color{purple}925*e^{0.035(0.5)} = \$ 941.33$

Close:

- with the cash we can buy the bond for $\color{purple}K_{T}$
- we can then return the bond to the person we shorted the underlying from 

net profit:

$\color{purple}\$941.33 - \$935 = \$6.33$

## 7. Forward examples: A stock

- We want to buy a stock at price $S_{s}(0)=\$150$. 
- The stock is to be bought in 9 months when funds are available. 
- Therefore a forward contract is preferred. 
- The risk free rate is $\color{purple}r = 4\%$. What is the forward price?

$$
K_T = S(0)e^{rT} \\
= \$150e^{0.04\frac{3}{4}} \\
= \$154.57
$$

what is the value of the forward contract in 3 months given the following situations? 
$$
V(t) =  S(t)-K_{T}e^{-rT-t}
$$


- $S(0.33) = \$130$
  - $V(0.25) = \$130 - \$154.57e^{0.04\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{4}}= - \$ 21.51$
  - the negative value shows that the long position is now losing money
- $S(0.33) = \$170$
  - $V(0.25) = \$170 - \$154.57e^{0.04\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{4}}=  \$ 18.49$
  - the positive value shows that the long position is now gaining money



## 8. Forwards on assets paying a known income

as of now:

underlying won't pay a fixed income to the holder.



consider:

underlying paying a fixed income to the holder. 



examples:

- coupon bearing bonds
- dividend paying stocks

two types of fixed income

- the asset pays a known income for the life of the forward contract
- the asset pays a know dividend yield

### 8.1 case 1: Known income

$\color{purple}I$ = the present value, at the inception of the contract ($\color{purple}t=0$), of the known income paid by the contract.



then considering arbitrage the forward contract price must be the following.
$$
K_{T}=(S(0) - I) e^{r_cT}
$$
we will establish this connection directly using **(reverse) cash and carry strategy**

> more generally we can denote $\color{purple}I(t)$ the present value at time $\color{purple}t$ of the income provided by the asset between $\color{purple}t$ and $\color{purple}T$

#### ***8.1.1 short position position arbitrage***

Suppose: 

$\color{purple}K_{T}>(S(0)-I)e^{r_cT}$



Strategy:

- take a short position in the forward contract
- take a long position in the underlying
- take on $\color{purple}S(0)$ debt which will have value $\color{purple}S(0)e^{r_ct}$ at time $\color{purple}t$ 

this portfolio will be held till $\color{purple}T$. at that time the following happens:

- the income accrued by the asset will be $\color{purple}Ie^{r_cT}$
- we get the value $\color{purple}K_{T}$ by selling the underlying
- we use our $\color{purple}K_{T}$ value to pay off our debt $\color{purple}S(0)e^{r_ct}$
- our total cash will be $\color{purple}K_{T}+ Ie^{r_cT}$

our portfolio consists of

- a short position in the forward contract
- a debt of $\color{purple}S(0)e^{r_ct}$
- the underlying
- a cash holding of $\color{purple}Ie^{r_cT}$

our inequality can be written as

$\color{purple}K_{T} + Ie^{r_cT} > S(0)e^{r_cT}$


#### ***8.1.2 long position arbitrage***

Suppose: $\color{purple}K_{T}<(S(0)-I)e^{r_cT}$

Strategy:

- take a long position on the forward contract
- short the underlying
- there is cash holding valued at $\color{purple}S(0)e^{rt}$ at time $\color{purple}t$

Holding this portfolio until time $\color{purple}T$

$\color{purple}K_{T} + Ie^{r_cT} < S(0)e^{r_cT}$

we have enough cash to:

- close our long position on the forward contract with our cash
- use the asset bought via contract to close our short position on the underlying.
- pay the future value of accrued income $\color{purple}Ie^{rT}$ which is owed to the asset's owner

so these actions will net us a profit:

$\color{purple}S(0)e^{rT} - K_{T} -Ie^{r_cT} > 0$

## 9. Forward valuation with known income

old formula for forward contract value disregarding income generating underlying.

$$
V(t) = S(t) - K_{T}e^{-r(T-t)}
$$
to get a formula taking to account income generation we need to extend notation.
$$
V(t; K, T)
$$

- dependency on the forward price ($\color{purple}K$) 
- dependency on expiration date ($\color{purple}T$)
- $\color{purple}K_{T}(t)$ fair forward price for forwards expiring at time $\color{purple}T$ that prevails in the market at time $\color{purple}t$

which means $\color{purple}K_{T}(t)$ is exactly the forward price such that 

$$
V(t; K_{T}(t), T) = 0
$$

> note that previously we computed $\color{purple}K_{T}(t)$ by doing $\color{purple}K_{T}(0) = K_{T}$

Non income generating underlying :arrow_right: The forward contract price equals the future value of the underlying asset. 

$$
K_{T}(t) = S(t)e^{r(T-t)}
$$
Income generating underlying :arrow_right: The forward contract price equals the future value of the underlying asset minus it's generated income between $\color{purple} t$ and $\color{purple}T$. 

$$
K_{T}(t) = (S(t) - I(t))e^{r(T-t)}
$$

> in our examination of future contracts this notation will be used to denote the prevailing market future price, which does not equal the forward price



given


$$
K_{T}(t) = (S(t) - I(t))e^{r(T-t)} \\
V(t; K, T) = ((S(t) - I(t)) - K_{T})e^{-r(T-t)}|
$$
the **forward contract value** can be written as 
$$
V(t; K, T) = (K_T(t) - K_{T})e^{-r(T-t)} \color{red}\text{(1)}
$$
we use an arbitrage argument to justify formula 1.

at time $\color{purple}t$ enter into 2 forward position:

1. long position in the forward contract, which means buying at time $\color{purple}T$ for price $\color{purple}K_T$.
2. short position in the forward contract, which means selling at time $\color{purple}T$ for price $\color{purple}K_T(t)$.

from time $t$ to $T$ we hold a portfolio of two forward positions.

at time $\color{purple}\tau (t \leq \tau \leq T)$
$$
V(\tau; K, T) - V(\tau;K_T(t), T)
$$
 since both contracts expire at $\color{purple}T$ our portfolio value at $\color{purple}\tau = T$ will be 
$$
V(T; K, T) - V(T;K_T(t), T) \\
= S(T) - K - (S(T) - K_T(t)) \\
= K_T(t) - K
$$
which will be cash payment. These are just the two forward prices contracted at the start.

using the law of one price this must mean that at any earlier time the portfolio value must equal the discounted value of this payment. 
$$
V(T; K, T) - V(T;K_T(t), T) = (K_T(t) - K)e^{-r(T-t)} \\
\to V(T; K, T) - 0 = (K_T(t) - K)e^{-r(T-t)} \\
\to V(T; K, T) = (K_T(t) - K)e^{-r(T-t)} \\
$$
where $\color{purple}V(T;K_T(t), T) = 0$ since $\color{purple}K_{T}(t)$ is the fair forward price for this contract. This established formula (1).

we can apply formula (1) to the case of a forward on an underlying generating a known income.
$$
K_T(t) = (S(t) - I(t))e^{r(T-t)}
$$
we substitute this in formula one
$$
V(t; K, T) = (K_T(t) - K_{T})e^{-r(T-t)} \color{red}\text{(1)}\\
V(t; K, T) = ((S(t) - I(t))e^{r(T-t)} - K_{T})e^{-r(T-t)} \\
\color{orange}V(t; K, T) = S(t) - I(t) - K_{T}e^{-r(T-t)}
$$
this is the value of long position in a forward contract at time $t$ for an asset paying a know income.

## 10. Forward on asset paying a known yield

Suppose:

- underlying asset for price $\color{purple}S(t)$
- a known dividend yield $\color{purple}y$ which is reinvested in the asset

Given an initial allocation $\color{purple}e^{-yT}$ value of our holding in the future will be:
$$
e^{-yT}e^{yt}S(t)=e^{-y(T-t)}S(t)
$$
which means we take the value of out asset but include the dividends earned between $t$ and $T$.

- we revalue it with our accumulated dividends reinvested in the asset (add dividend earned up till now)
- discounted it with initial allocation (take away dividends that you know will be earned by maturity)

at time $T$ the investment will be worth
$$
e^{-y(T-T)}S(T) = S(T)
$$
which means exactly the value of the underlying at time $T$

this implies a total investment at time 0
$$
e^{-yT}S(0)
$$
is equivalent to the asset value 
$$
S(T)
$$
at time $T$

### 10.1 Forward price of an underlying with known yield

$$
K_T = e^{(r-y)T}S(0)
$$

- minus $y$ because we cannot accumulate the yield as long as we do not hold the asset
- times $r$ because we want to know what $S(0)$ would be valued as at time $T$ 

> the only adjustment we made is adding the $-y$



now we will derive formula $K_T = e^{(r-y)T}S(0)$ using the **replicating portfolio approach**.



previously we had described the payoff for the long position at time $T$ for the forward contract as
$$
S(T)-K_{T}
$$

| Term    | explanation                                                  | replication                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| $S(T)$  | an allocation of $e^{-yT}$ in the underlying asset           | $e^{-y(T-t)}S(t)$                  |
| $K_{T}$ | taking on debt at time zero equal to the discounted value of $K_T$ | $-e^{rt}e^{-rT}K_T=e^{-r(T-t)}K_T$ |

this gives us portfolio at time $t$ the value
$$
V(t)=e^{-y(T-t)}S(t)-e^{-r(T-t)}K_{T}
$$
now check for equality with forward payoff at time $T$ 
$$
V(T)=e^{-y(T-T)}S(T)-e^{-r(T-T)}K_{T} \\
V(T)=S(T)-K_{T}
$$
the law of one price states that $V(t)$ will be equal to the value of the forward contract any $t<T$



now to determine the forward price we will assume

- $t=0$
- $V(0)=0$

$$
V(0)=e^{-y(T)}S(0)-e^{-r(T)}K_{T} \\
\text{solve for forward price } K_{T} \\
\rightarrow e^{-r(T)}K_{T}=e^{-y(T)}S(0)  \\
\rightarrow K_{T}=e^{-y(T)}e^{r(T)}S(0)  \\
\rightarrow K_{T}=e^{-y(T)+r(T)}S(0)  \\
\rightarrow K_{T}=e^{(r-y)T}S(0)  \\
$$

this verifies the initial stated formula $K_{T}=e^{(r-y)T}S(0)$ for forward price. This is the forward price for a forward contract on an asset paying a known dividend $y$

#### cost of carry

the finance charge net the income paid by the asset
$$
\text{cost of carry} = r -y
$$
if the underlying asset is a commodity
$$
y = c-s
$$
$s$ = rate of storage cost

$r$ = convenience yield

for commodity underlying cost of carry will be 
$$
\text{cost of carry} = r + s - c
$$

## 13. FX forwards

the underlying here is a foreign currency. a fx forward contract will lock in a particular exchange rate on the contract expiration date. 

$r_{f}$ = risk free rate foreign currency

$r_{d}$ = risk free rate domestic currency

a holding in a foreign currency can be considered to be invested at $r_{f}$. We can thus regard holdings in foreign currency as an income paying asset with a known yield $y=r_{f}$.

> we will apply theory on income bearing underlying with known yield to the FX forwards.

$S(t)$ = spot exchange rate, price in domestic currency for a unit of foreign currency 

$K_{T}$ = forward price, forward exchange rate or forward rate

> based on theory on income bearing assets we can construct following forward rate for a contract expiring at time $T$

$$
K_{T}= e^{(r_{d}-r_{f)}T}S(0)
$$

this forward rate formula has been known independent of the theory of derivatives but it is called **interest parity relationship** we will explore the traditional argument for deriving it

### 13.1 interest rate parity

> this is similar to the cash and carry arbitrage argument

Suppose:
$$
K > e^{(r_d-r_f)T}S(0)
$$
forward rate is overpriced for contract expiring at time $T$ :arrow_right: short forward contract for arbitrage.

we can rewrite this inequality
$$
Ke^{(r_f)T}\frac{1}{S(0)} > e^{(r_d)T}
$$
Say we apply this to a notional amount of $\$ 1000$.
$$
K*e^{(r_f)T}*\frac{1000}{S(0)} > 1000e^{(r_d)T} \\
\text{\{to domestic\} \{invest at foreign risk free rate\} \{to foreign\} > debt}
$$

- $1000e^{(r_d)T}$ = value of at time $T$ of $\$1000$ borrowed at time $t=0$
- $\frac{1000}{S(0)}$ = value in foreign currency of $\$1000$ of domestic currency at time $t=0$
- $e^{(r_f)T}$ = value of at time $T$ of $\$1000$ worth of foreign currency valued at time $t=0$
- $K$ = convert future value of the $\$1000$ worth of foreign currency back to domestic at future rate locked in

This inequality states that a debt of $\$1000$ at time $t$ is smaller than if took $\$1000$ worth of foreign currency invested it in the $r_{f}$ and converted it back under forward rate $K$.

This inequality implies that if we are seller of our invested foreign currency at rate $K$ we will have a certain profit / arbitrage.

strategy

1. borrow $\$1000$ in domestic currency at $r_{d}$
2. convert borrowed money to foreign at $\frac{1}{S(0)}$
3. invest foreign currency at $r_f$
4. at expiration sell foreign currency at the contracted rate $K$, use this money to pay off the debt 

Suppose:
$$
K < e^{(r_d-r_f)T}S(0)
$$
Strategy

1. borrow $\$1000$ worth in foreign currency at $r_{f}$
2. convert borrowed money to domestic at $S(0)$
3. invest domestic currency at $r_d$
4. at expiration get back foreign currency at the contracted rate $K$, use this money to pay off the debt 

> both inequalities will lead to arbitrage which means we can rule them out thus equality must hold
> $$
> K_{T} = e^{(r_d-r_f)T}S(0)
> $$

### 13.2 FX forwards examples

#### 13.2.1 example 1

<img src="C:\Users\belke\Documents\quantative-finance\courses\financial-derivatives-a-quantative-finance-view\images\Screenshot 2023-05-08 134207.png" alt="example" style="zoom:67%;" />
$$
S(0) = 1.20 \ eur/usd\\
r_d = 0.05 \\
r_d = 0.05 \\
K = e^{(r_d-r_f)T}S(0)
$$

$$
K = e^{-0.03*0.05}1.2 = 1.1821\\
$$

how would you take advantage of following rates: $1.21$ and $1.15$

##### 13.2.1.1 short

$$
1.21 > e^{(r_d-r_f)T}S(0) = 1.1821
$$

we will short the forward contract:

Strategy:

- borrow x amount of USD at $r_d$
- convert money to EUR and invest at $r_f$
- at time $T$ sell the foreign currency for $K$ use that money to pay off the debt

$$
\texteuro = \frac{1000}{1.2} = \texteuro833.33 \\
\texteuro = \texteuro833.3 * e^{r_fT} = \texteuro833.3 * e^{0.08*0.5} = \texteuro867.34 \\
\$ = 867.34 * 1.21 = \$1049.48 \\
\text{debt} = \$1000 * e^{0.05*0.5} = \$1025.32 \\
\text{net profit} = \$1049.48 - \$1025.32 = \$24.16
$$

##### 13.2.1.2 long

$$
1.15 < e^{(r_d-r_f)T}S(0) = 1.1821
$$

we will long the forward contract

Strategy:

- borrow x in EUR at $r_f$
- convert to USD and invest at  $r_d$
- at time $T$ we use USD to convert it at $K$ to EUR
- pay off debt with converted EUR

$$
\$ = 1000 * 1.2 = \$1200 \\
\$ = 1150 * e^{0.05*0.5} = \${1230.38} \\
\texteuro = \frac{\${1230.38}}{1.15} = 1069.90 \\
\text{debt} = \texteuro1000 * e^{0.08*0.5} = {1040.81} \\
\text{debt in usd} = \texteuro{1040.81} * 1.15 = \${1196.93} \\
\text{net profit in eur} = \texteuro1069.90 - \texteuro1040.81 = \texteuro29.09 \\
\text{net profit in usd} = \$1230.38 - \${1196.93}= \$33.45
$$

### 13.2.2 example 2

$$
m = \frac{2}{12} \\
x = AU\$ 10.000.000 \\
S(0)= 0.75 \frac{AU\$}{\$} \\
r_{d} = 4\% \\
r_{f} = 6\% \\
$$
i would set up a contract to lock in the future $\frac{AU\$}{\$}$ exchange rate.

The forward rate would be expected to be 
$$
K = e^{(r_d-r_f)T}S(0)\\
K = e^{(-0.02)*\frac{2}{12}}0.75 \frac{AU\$}{\$} = 0.7475 \frac{AU\$}{\$} \\
$$
this would mean that we will pay $\$0.738$ per unit of $AU\$$.

suppose the rate goes to $0.71 \frac{AU\$}{\$}$ this would be a bad thing because we are in a long position on the contract.
$$
V(t) = e^{-r_f(T-t)}S(t) - e^{-r_d(T-t)}K_{T} \\
V(\frac{1}{12}) = e^{-0.06(\frac{1}{12})}0.71 - e^{-0.04(\frac{1}{12})}0.7475  \\
V(\frac{1}{12}) = \$-0,03855
$$
this is the value of a forward on 1 Australian dollar. which on 10 mil would mean a loss of $\$385500$

## 14. future contract

forwards and futures are similar but not the same.

**future contract** = contract between a seller and a buyer to sell a certain asset at a fixed time in the future at a price that is agreed to when the contract is written

> BUT futures are traded on exchanged while forwards are private

- A small number of future contracts will be held till expiration, on exchange a position will be closed out by entering in the opposite position offsetting the original position. This way the exchange will treat both positions as terminated.
- Usually futures are hold for risk management or speculation purposes thanks to the exposure they provide to certain assets. 
- Normally the intend is not to hold the future contract until delivery.
- Futures reliable provide exposure to the asset because they closely track the spot price.



## 15. futures prices

- future contract => **future price**
- forward contract => **forward price**

$K_{T}(t)$ = future price for contract initiated at time $t$ expiring at time $T$

- like for forwards the future price should be set so that the future contract is worth $0$ at time $t$
- future price are result of market supply & demand
- $K_T(t)$ is not price for a particular contract but the market observed price at time $t$

### 15.1 influence of cash market on future market

- future prices will represent market expectations of **future spot prices**
- quantitative this can be shown as $K_T(t) = E(S(T)|f_t)$
  - conditional expected value of the future spot price on time $T$ given knowledge on time $t$
  - $E(.|f_t)$ = expectation conditional on knowledge at time $t$

- the principle is backed by arbitrage, because systematic over/under estimation of expiration spot price would open up arbitrage opportunities

> Future price however is not a good estimation for future spot price.
>
> Deviations from the future spot price will generally be attributed to a **risk premium**
>
> Hedgers are willing to pay extra for the certainty of a locked in price.

in short what influences future prices is:

- expectation of future spot price
- risk premia

> future price $K_T(t)$ will be price for a natural unit of the underlying $\neq$ contract size

#### 15.1.1 example of difference between future price and contract size

Crude oil will have $K_{T}{t}$ be price for one barrel of crude oil. 

On the NYMEX oil futures is 1000 barrels.

thus when working with a concrete future contract example we must multiply by contract size and number of contracts.

### 15.2 forward vs future price

$F_T(t) \neq K_T(t)$

- forward prices are negotiated in OTC which makes for less transparency
- in forward contract counter party credit risk is a real concern while for the future the exchange will be the counterparty
- future contrast will settle up on daily basis (**marking to market**) while forwards contracts only settle on expiration. So future contracts will have a daily cash flow exchange while forward contracts only exchange on expiration  

> usually future and forward prices don't deviate much because in practice they are subject to a lot of the same forces

## 16. Futures marking to market

marking to market process = daily settlement of the contract.

- days of future contract life are $t_1,t_2, ...,t_n = T$. 
- from $t_1$ to $t_2$ future price will go from $K_{T}(t_1)$ to  $K_{T}(t_2)$
- the impact of this price change for a **short position** will be.
  - positive if the price goes down  $K_{T}(t_2) < K_{T}(t_1)$, we will be selling at a better price.
    - the short position will gain if $K_{T}(t_1) - K_{T}(t_2) > 0$
    - at day 2 $K_{T}(t_1) - K_{T}(t_2)$ will be the cash payment made to the short account
  - negative if the price goes up $K_{T}(t_2) > K_{T}(t_1)$, we will be selling at a worse price.
    - the short position will lose if $K_{T}(t_1) - K_{T}(t_2) < 0$
    - at day 2 $K_{T}(t_2) - K_{T}(t_1)$ will be the cash payment charged on the short account

- the impact of this price change for a **long position** will be.
  - positive if the price goes up $K_{T}(t_1) < K_{T}(t_2)$, we will be buying at a better price.
    - the long position will gain if $K_{T}(t_2) - K_{T}(t_1) > 0$
    - at day 2 $K_{T}(t_2) - K_{T}(t_1)$ will be the cash payment made to the long account
  - negative if the price goes down $K_{T}(t_1) > K_{T}(t_2)$, we will be buying at a worse price.
    - the long position will lose if $K_{T}(t_2) - K_{T}(t_1) < 0$
    - at day 2 $K_{T}(t_1) - K_{T}(t_2)$ will be the cash payment charged on the long account

> when calculating the cashflow during a settlement we must be sure to multiply by number of contracts and contract size 

### 16.1 daily settlements for long position

$$

### 16.4 futures margin accounts

margins: when a new future position is opened, an investor must post an **initial margin** in cash in a **margin account** with an exchange.

- proceeds from daily settlement are deposited in this margin account.
- losses will be deducted from the margin account 
- a margin account is required to maintain a **maintenance margin** which is less than the initial margin
- a **margin call** is a notification to the investor that they dipped below the maintenance margin
- the purpose off the margin is to ensure collateral so that the investor can meet the daily settlement requirements

## 17. future prices and spot prices

### 17.1 distinction from forwards



in a forward contract the long position is the right and obligation to at expiration receive the spot minus forward price cashflow
$$
S(T) - K
$$

> no money is exchanged until the expiration date 

in a future contract the long position is the right and obligation to receive cashflows on each daily settlement during the contracts life
$$
K_T(t_2) - K_T(t_1)\\
K_T(t_3) - K_T(t_2)\\
...\\
K_T(t_n) - K_T(t_{n-1})\\
$$

> most of the time this is eliminated before expiration

#### 17.1.1 Connection with forward prices

The cash and carry arguments that were used to derive the forward price on forward contracts will thus not work on future prices for future contracts because these have marked to **marked to market future positions**.

In practice however future and forward prices seem to be closely related.

- if interest rates are constant or uncorrelated with the underlying price, theoretical arbitrage arguments imply that forward and future prices agree
- empirically it is observed that future prices track spot prices in a manner consistent with the relations of the form $\color{purple}K_T(t) = e^{c(T-t)}S(t)$ with $c$ being the applicable cost of carry 
  - regard the right hand side as the base level around which the future price fluctuates
  - if there is to much deviation from the base level arbitrage will kick in
  - this is an arbitrage relation not one of cause and effect, this does not mean that spot price drives future prices it may be that the reverse is true

#### 17.1.2 convergence of future and spot prices

<img src="C:\Users\belke\Documents\quantative-finance\courses\financial-derivatives-a-quantative-finance-view\images\Screenshot 2023-05-22 155710.png" style="zoom: 33%;" />
$$
\color{purple}K_T(t) = e^{c(T-t)}S(t)
$$
during the delivery month, the future price must equal the spot price.
$$
K_T(T) = S(T)
$$


##### 17.1.2.1 prove using arbitrage



suppose:
$$
K_T(T) > S(T)
$$
this would mean we would realize arbitrage by:

1. take a short position.
2. purchase the underlying asset on cash market
3. immediately make delivery

this would give a profit of:
$$
K_T(T) - S(T) > 0
$$

---

suppose:
$$
K_T(T) < S(T)
$$
this would mean we would realize arbitrage by:

1. take a long position.
2. purchase at future price at delivery
3. immediately sell underlying on spot market

this would give a profit of:
$$
S(T) - K_T(T)  > 0
$$
the for times $t < T$ we expect as $t$ approaches $T$ that $K_T(t)$ and $S(t)$ should approach each other. In general, there are deviations in different local cash markets. This is what is meant by future basis.



##### 17.1.2.2 summary

1. arbitrage relationship
   - $K_T(t) = e^{c(T-t)}S(t)$
   - can be expected to hold to some approximate degree in most markets
2. convergence of future to spot
   - $K_T(t) = S(T)$
   - holds to within the basis

> because of this holding a position in a future contract is similar to holding a position in the underlying itself

## 18. Future Contracts and Cash Exposure

we have seen that future and spot prices are closely linked. 

mainly we have seen that:

- future and spot prices converge at expiration $K_T(T) = S(T)$
- the arbitrage relationship $K_T(t) = e^{c(T-t)}S(t)$
  - c is the cost of carry holding to some degree off approximation

> the main takeaway is that we can get exposure to the cash market by taking a position in a future

### 18.1 prove exposure to cash market via future market

suppose: 
$$
c = 0
$$
this will have as a consequence:
$$
K_T(t) = e^{0(T-t)}S(t)\\
K_T(t) = S(t)\\
$$
future price is equal to the spot price. So taking a position results in a direct exposure to the asset itself.



considering the market to market mechanism the exposure will have an immediate impact.



given a long position the following will be our cashflows per unit:
$$
K_T(t_2)-K_T(t_1) = S(t_2)-S(t_1)
$$
given $C$ contract size and $J$ contracts this would result in a total position change of
$$
JC(K_T(t_2)-K_T(t_1)) = JC(S(t_2)-S(t_1))
$$
the daily price changes will result in following cash flows for the long position
$$
JC(S({t_2}) - S({t_1}))\\
JC(S({t_3}) - S({t_2}))\\
...\\
JC(S({t_n}) - S({t_{n-1}}))\\
$$

> this is the same P&L an outright long position owning $JC$ units of the underlying asset would expose us to.

this again proving our main point.

> we can get the same exposure to the underlying asset and it's cash market price by taking a position in a future contracts as we would in an outright cash position.



## 19. futures hedging

**futures hedging** = using futures in a portfolio to manage risk the portfolio is already exposed to.

> we keep assuming $c = 0$ thus $K_T(t) = S(t)$

Suppose:

we are long || short an asset, the cash price per unit of the asset is $S(t)$ we are long || short $N$ units

For instance:

- $S(t)$ price of a share || price of a barrel of crude oil
- $N$ shares || barrels of crude oil

Here we are exposed to **price risk** and the control of price risk is one of the most sought after risk management services.

One way to mediate price risk is to engage in a future position the opposite of your cash position in the asset.



Suppose:

$C$ units of the asset is the contract size. if we want to have an equivalent position to our $N$ units we will need $J$ contracts equal to.
$$
J = \frac{N}{C}
$$
we just assume that $J$ is an integer while in reality that would usually would not be the case.

If we could hedge our whole position using futures this would be called a **unitary hedge**.



Suppose: 

we go long $N$ units in the cash market and short $J$ future contracts
$$
W(t)
$$
the value of the portfolio holding the future and cash positions.
$$
W(t) = NS(t) + \text{short futures position value}
$$
> the value of the short future position will reset because of the marked to market mechanism

the one day change can be represented as 
$$
\triangle W(t) = \triangle cash + \triangle futures \\
\triangle W(t) = N \triangle S(t) - N \triangle K_T(t) \\
\triangle W(t) = N (S(t_2) - S(t_1)) - N (K_T(t_2) - K_T(t_1)) \\
\triangle W(t) = N (S(t_2) - S(t_1)) - N (S(t_2) - S(t_1)) \\
\triangle W(t) = 0 \\
$$
We have completely negated our risk.

$$
\triangle W(t) = N (S(t_2) - K_T(t_2)) - N \triangle (S(t_1) - K_T(t_1)) \\
\triangle W(t) = N b(t_2) - N \triangle b(t_1)  \\
