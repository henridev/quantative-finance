# Problem set 3

## 1

$P_{a-nyse}(0) = \$80$

$P_{a-otc}(0) = \$72$ 

we would short the overpriced share on the NYSE and long the underpriced share on the OTC market. This would pocket us $\$80 - \$72 = \$8$ per share.

## 2

at $t=1$ the relationship is the following. $2P_{a}(1) + P_{b}(1) = P_{c}(1)$

so according to arbitrage a $t=0$ this relationship must hold which is not the case because.

$2*100 + 50 = 250$

this means that at $t=0$ $P_c(0)$ can be considered underpriced.

what we thus should do is short A and B and long C

we can short 2 of A and one of B which will give us $\$250$ cash which will be used to long C this will make it that we have $\$30$ cash left which we can invest at the risk free rate.

when at $t=1$ we close our positions we will need sell C which will give us either $\$200$ or $\$540$. 

this money can be used to close out or short positions which in the end will leave us with the cash invested at the risk free rate 

$\$30*e^{r_c(t)t}$

### 3

$P_{oil}(0) = \$64$

$P_{oil}(1) = \$67$

$r_c(1)=3\%$

we could borrow $\$64$ dollars and use it to  buy oil now, this would mean in one year the debt is worth $\$64 * e^{0.03} = \$65.95$. at $t=1$ we can sell the oil bought leaving us $\$67-\$65.95 = \$1.05$ which brings our total to $\$1.05$

### 4

relations:

$P_{a}(1) + P_{b}(1) + P_{c}(1) = 60 = 5P_{d}(1)$

which would mean now that we have 

$15 + 10 + 14 = 39 = (5 * P_d(0))$ so $P_d(0)$ should be $\$9$ instead it is $\$10$. d is thus over priced and should be a short position. the other shares we go long on by lending first for $\$50$ with which we  buy one share of A, B, C leaving us with $\$11$ of cash to invest. At $t=1$ we can close our positions on A,B,C by selling and using the money to buy 5 shares of D to close out that position too.

our $\$11e^{r_{c}(1)*1}$ will be our riskless profit.
